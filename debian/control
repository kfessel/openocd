Description: Open on-chip JTAG debug solution for ARM and MIPS systems
 OpenOCD is an on-chip debugging, in-system programming and boundary-scan
 testing tool for ARM and MIPS systems.
 .
 The debugger uses an IEEE 1149-1 compliant JTAG TAP bus master to access
 on-chip debug functionality available on ARM based microcontrollers or
 system-on-chip solutions. For MIPS systems the EJTAG interface is supported.
 .
 User interaction is realized through a telnet command line interface,
 a gdb (the GNU debugger) remote protocol server, and a simplified RPC
 connection that can be used to interface with OpenOCD's Jim Tcl engine.
 .
 OpenOCD supports many different types of JTAG interfaces/programmers.
